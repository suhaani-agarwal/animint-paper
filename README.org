Title: animint2 R package for animated, interactive ggplots

Abstract: Interactive web graphics are great for communication and knowledge sharing, but are difficult to leverage during the exploratory phase of a data science workflow. We propose the R package animint2 for rapid creation of linked and animated web graphics through a simple extension (fork) of ggplot2â€™s implementation of the Grammar of Graphics. It has been collaboratively developed since 2013, is available on CRAN, and has extensive documentation and testing. In this talk I will give a brief tutorial on how animint2 can be used to create and publish animated, interactive web graphics.
